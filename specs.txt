Please implement a Node.JS server with a GraphQL based API that has the abilities to Create, Read, Update, & Delete Locations & Events. We would also like to be able to query and find all the locations & events belonging to an organization, as well as the reverse: being able to query a location(s) / event(s) and having the ability to find the organization it belongs to.

This is what the schema of the the database should look like:

- Organization -

Name

CreatedAt

UpdatedAt

- Locations (belongs to Organization): -

Name

Address

Latitude

Longitude

CreatedAt

UpdatedAt

- Events (belongs to Organization): -

Name

Date / Time (can modify these columns to fit your needs better.

Doesnâ€™t have to be exactly one column)

Description

CreatedAt

UpdatedAt

Bonus: When a user submits a location with an address, the latitude & longitude is gathered via the Google Places API

Please keep in mind we will be reviewing the architecture and modularization of your code, so having it work well is only part of the project. Feel free to use any packages you would like to get the project working.
